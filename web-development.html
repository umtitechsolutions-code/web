      <h1>Top Rated Web Development Services</h1>

      <p class="lead">UMTI Tech builds web applications that combine clean engineering, fast user experiences, and measurable business outcomes. Whether you need a high-converting marketing site, a scalable SaaS platform, or a resilient e-commerce store, our team delivers production-ready solutions engineered for growth.</p>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>Our web development services cover the full product lifecycle: strategy & discovery, UX and frontend design, backend and API development, integrations, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. We specialise in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Full-stack web applications</strong> — modern architectures using React, Vue, or Svelte on the frontend and Node.js, Django, or Laravel on the backend.</li>
        <li><strong>E-commerce platforms</strong> — custom stores, headless commerce, and platform migrations that prioritise conversion and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</strong> — app-like experiences that work offline and load fast on mobile devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance-first frontends</strong> — critical CSS, image optimisation, code-splitting and Lighthouse-focused improvements to reduce Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and improve Core Web Vitals.</li>
        <li><strong>API & microservices</strong> — resilient, well-documented APIs, event-driven services, and scalable backend systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why clients choose UMTI Tech</h2>
      <p>We focus on delivering measurable results and sustainable systems. Our approach includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Outcome-driven development</strong> — we tie feature roadmaps to KPIs like conversion, retention, and performance metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Engineering quality</strong> — automated tests, code reviews, CI/CD pipelines and clear runbooks for production incidents.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability</strong> — architectures that handle traffic growth, caching strategies and cloud cost optimisation.</li>
        <li><strong>User-centred design</strong> — pragmatic UX that focuses on clarity, accessibility and conversion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our process</h2>
      <p>We work in short, verifiable phases to reduce risk and deliver value quickly:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Discovery & prioritisation</strong> — 1–2 weeks: align on goals, audit architecture and prioritise features.</li>
        <li><strong>Design & prototype</strong> — 2–4 weeks: interactive prototypes and performance targets.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation</strong> — 1–3 months: iterate in sprints, automated testing and incremental releases.</li>
        <li><strong>Launch & operate</strong> — production rollouts, monitoring, and iterative optimisation.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Performance & SEO</h2>
      <p>Performance and search visibility are core to our builds. We deliver:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimised loading paths and critical CSS inlining for faster first paint.</li>
        <li>Modern image formats (WebP/AVIF), responsive images and lazy-loading strategies.</li>
        <li>Structured data (JSON-LD) for pages and articles to improve search result appearance.</li>
        <li>Server-side rendering or static rendering options when needed for SEO-critical pages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security & reliability</h2>
      <p>Security is built into our process. We perform threat modelling, dependency audits, secure authentication patterns, and automated backups. Production environments include monitoring, alerting and incident response playbooks.</p>

      <h2>Results & impact</h2>
      <p>We have helped clients achieve dramatic improvements in user engagement and business metrics, such as reduced bounce rates, faster checkout flows that increase conversion, and APIs that scale with concurrent users without downtime.</p>
