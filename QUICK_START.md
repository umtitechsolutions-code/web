## ⚠️ BEFORE DEPLOYMENT - CRITICAL

### Change API URL (Optional)

API paths are now relative by default (e.g., `/api/...`), which works for most Hostinger setups using a proxy or same-domain backend. 

If you need to use a different backend URL, edit `frontend/js/api-config.js`:

```javascript
const API_CONFIG = {
    // Replace "" with "https://your-api-domain.com" if needed
    BASE_URL: "", 
    ...
};
```

   - Add your website
   - Submit `sitemap.xml`
   - Request indexing

2. **Test Meeting Form**
   - Fill out form on homepage
   - Check it saves to database

## 📈 SEO Timeline (Realistic)

| Timeframe | Expected Results |
|-----------|------------------|
| Week 1 | Site indexed by Google |
| Week 2-4 | 10-50 visitors/day |
| Month 2-3 | 100-500 visitors/day |
| Month 4-6 | 500-2000+ visitors/day, first-page rankings |

> **Important**: First-page Google rankings require 3-6 months of consistent work (content, backlinks, optimization). Technical SEO is done, but ongoing effort is needed.
